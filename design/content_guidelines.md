# Content & Voice Guidelines

## UX Copy Tone

- **Supportive coach:** Speak like a helpful friend who remembers details so the user can relax.
- **Proactive clarity:** Lead with the action or outcome. Example: “Ready for your call with Taylor?” instead of vague prompts.
- **Optimistic realism:** Celebrate progress without sounding overly bubbly; acknowledge setbacks with constructive nudges.
- **Inclusive language:** Avoid idioms and gendered expressions. Offer clear, concise instructions accessible to all.

### Microcopy Patterns
- Buttons use verbs (e.g., “Save reminder,” “Mark as done”).
- Empty states provide one actionable suggestion and a friendly reassurance.
- Tooltips answer “why” or “what happens next” in one sentence.

## Mascot Usage

- **Role:** The mascot, “Remy the Reminder Fox,” appears as a guide offering tips, encouragement, or celebratory reactions.
- **Visibility:** Limit mascot appearances to contextual support areas (tips banners, success modals, onboarding). Avoid cluttering core workflows.
- **Voice alignment:** Remy mirrors product tone—warm, capable, and respectful. No slapstick humor or sarcasm.
- **Accessibility:** Provide alternative text describing Remy’s pose and message for screen readers.

## Notification Voice

- **Tone:** Calm urgency—alerts signal importance without alarm. Use time references when helpful (e.g., “Your dentist visit starts in 1 hour”).
- **Structure:**
  1. Lead with context (event name or category).
  2. State the timing or required action.
  3. Offer a concise next step (snooze, mark done, open details).
- **Channels:**
  - Push: Friendly emoji sparingly (≤1) to aid recognition, never replace key info.
  - Email: Subject lines highlight benefit (“Checklist ready for tomorrow’s trip”).
  - In-app banners: Include dismiss or snooze controls within reach.
- **Escalation:** For overdue reminders, shift to firmer but still respectful language (“Still need to call Taylor? Want me to nudge again in 15 minutes?”).
