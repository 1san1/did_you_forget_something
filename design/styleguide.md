## Typography

- **Primary typeface:** Inter
  - Headings: SemiBold, tight leading for confident presence.
  - Body: Regular, relaxed leading for readability.
- **Fallback stack:** `"Inter", "Segoe UI", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`
- **Display scale:**
  - H1 — 32px / 40px line-height
  - H2 — 24px / 32px
  - H3 — 20px / 28px
  - Body — 16px / 24px
  - Caption — 14px / 20px
- **Voice & emphasis:** Use sentence case and sparing bold to reinforce calm reassurance.

## Iconography

- **Style:** Rounded corners, thin 2px strokes, filled where emphasis required.
- **Source:** Prefer Phosphor Icons or similar friendly icon sets.
- **Usage:** Icons should clarify actions, not decorate. Always pair with accessible labels.
- **Mascot integration:** Mascot avatar can appear alongside icons to signal tips or celebratory states.

## Motion Principles

- **Purposeful:** Animations should indicate cause and effect (e.g., reminder card expands from tapped position).
- **Calming tempo:** Duration 200–300ms with ease-in-out curves to maintain approachable feel.
- **Responsive:** Provide micro-interactions (button presses, checklist ticks) with subtle scale and color transitions.
- **Assistive:** Use motion to reinforce success (mascot waving, checklist items subtly popping) without overwhelming.
