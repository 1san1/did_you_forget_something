# Did You Forget Something?

A Flutter application that keeps you prepared with contextual reminders, smart checklists, and routines inspired by the supporting product and architecture documentation in this repository.

## Sprint 1 â€“ Foundation

This iteration lays the groundwork for the mobile experience:

- Flutter project scaffold with Material 3 theming.
- Riverpod-powered application state container and theme controller.
- Hive-based local storage service ready for checklists, reminders, and routines.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter following the official [setup guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Fetch dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
