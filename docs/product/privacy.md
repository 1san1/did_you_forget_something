# Privacy & Compliance Plan

This document outlines early safeguards for traveler data, covering consent-driven analytics and user-controlled export capabilities.

## Principles
- **Consent First:** Collect only the data required for delivering reminders, and offer opt-in toggles for any ancillary analytics.
- **Transparency:** Provide in-app disclosures summarizing what data is captured, how it is used, and retention policies.
- **Control:** Ensure travelers can access, export, and delete their data without filing support tickets.

## Opt-In Analytics
- Present a just-in-time consent dialog during onboarding that explains analytics benefits and allows granular toggles (usage metrics, feature feedback, diagnostics).
- Persist consent choices in a dedicated `user_preferences` table with timestamps and provenance for auditability.
- Anonymize analytics events by default, hashing user identifiers and excluding PII payloads unless a user explicitly grants enhanced diagnostics.
- Offer a persistent settings page where travelers can revoke analytics participation; revocations trigger suppression of future events and purge queued analytics batches.
- Run periodic compliance checks to ensure analytics pipelines honor opt-out flags, with alerts surfaced to the compliance channel.

## Data Export & Portability
- Provide self-service exports (JSON + CSV) of trips, checklists, reminders, and item histories via an asynchronous job that deposits encrypted bundles in object storage.
- Require step-up authentication (recent password entry or MFA) before generating exports to prevent unauthorized access.
- Maintain export logs noting requester, timestamp, and bundle contents for compliance review.
- Establish retention limits (e.g., 7 days) for download links; expired bundles are automatically purged from storage.
- Document API endpoints so that enterprise customers can programmatically retrieve exports subject to the same consent gates.

## Compliance Roadmap
- Map practices to GDPR, CCPA, and upcoming US state privacy laws, highlighting lawful bases for processing and user rights coverage.
- Schedule annual privacy impact assessments and vendor audits (analytics platforms, storage providers).
- Integrate data processing agreements (DPAs) with key vendors and maintain an inventory of subprocessors shared with customers.
- Implement automated deletion workflows triggered by account closure or retention policy thresholds, with verification checkpoints.
