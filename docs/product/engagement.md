# Engagement Strategy

## Gamification Elements
- **Daily Streaks:** Track consecutive days of completing key tasks, with visual streak indicators and escalating milestones at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days.
- **Progress Levels:** Award experience points for completing actions (task completion, sharing feedback, inviting friends) and unlock themed interface elements at each level.
- **Challenges & Quests:** Offer rotating weekly challenges tailored to user segments, combining collaborative goals (team quests) and solo achievements.
- **Leaderboards:** Provide opt-in leaderboards for friend groups or teams, emphasizing relative improvement rather than absolute totals.
- **Achievement Badges:** Curated badge sets for mastery (e.g., "Consistency Pro"), learning milestones, and community contributions.

## Reward Triggers
- **Behavioral Triggers:** Deliver immediate feedback (animations, micro-copy) after task completion and nudge reminders before streak breaks.
- **Milestone Rewards:** Grant bonus points, limited-time themes, or partner perks when users hit major streak or level thresholds.
- **Social Recognition:** Highlight badges and achievements on profile cards and push notifications to opted-in friends or teammates.
- **Personalized Insights:** Unlock tailored insights reports after consecutive weeks of engagement to reinforce perceived value.
- **Surprise & Delight:** Introduce periodic mystery rewards (e.g., double XP weekends) to sustain curiosity and re-engagement.
