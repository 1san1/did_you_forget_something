# Product Brief: "Did You Forget Something?" Assistant

## Vision
Deliver a proactive, context-aware assistant that ensures travelers never forget critical items or tasks, regardless of trip complexity.

## Target Users
- Overbooked professionals requiring time-saving automation.
- Family coordinators balancing shared responsibilities.
- Adventure planners needing specialized guidance.
- Operations teams supporting executive or field travel.

## Problem Statement
Travel preparation is fragmented across calendars, email confirmations, and generic checklists, leading to overlooked essentials, stressful departures, and costly last-minute purchases.

## MVP Scope
- **Smart Intake:** Import travel plans from calendar/email and capture trip metadata (destination, duration, purpose).
- **Adaptive Checklists:** Generate dynamic packing and task lists that adjust based on trip type, weather, and traveler profile.
- **Notification Engine:** Multi-channel reminders (push, email, SMS) with escalating urgency as departure approaches.
- **Progress Tracking:** Simple completion dashboard with status sharing for households or teams.
- **Content Library:** Curated templates for common trip types (business, family vacation, adventure).

## Differentiators
- Contextual intelligence combining calendar signals, weather APIs, and traveler preferences.
- Collaborative readiness tracking for families and teams.
- Predictive alerting that surfaces overlooked requirements (e.g., visas, equipment servicing) ahead of deadlines.
- Flexible notification channels with explainable reasoning behind each reminder.

## Success Metrics
- **Activation:** 60% of new users connect a calendar or email source within first week.
- **Engagement:** 75% weekly active users interacting with at least one reminder or checklist item.
- **Retention:** 45% of users creating three or more trips within first quarter.
- **Outcome:** 90% of surveyed users report reduced forgotten items versus prior process.
- **Revenue:** Achieve $10 average monthly revenue per paying user by end of Year 1.
